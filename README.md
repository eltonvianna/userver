# Summary

This is my implementation of a micro application server.

## The back end development

I've decided to use only the Java 8 API to implement very simple socket server, except the import of some test libraries, such JUnit, JBehave, Mockito, etc, required to create and perform unit and behavior tests. The micro server is **fully stateless** was implemented as way to provide the web resources and data to the front end layer. The **ResourceRequestHandler** is responsible to handle all http resource requests and the **RestRequestHandler** is responsible to handle all http service requests.

## Tdd aproach

The TDD approach was applied using JUnit as way to cover the unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Installation of **Java 8** and **Maven 3**. Add **JAVA_HOME/jre/bin** and **M2_HOME/bin** to the **PATH** environment variable. Also is required access to the internet as way to access the Maven Central repository.

## Getting Started

After cloned this project, change to **userver** directory and run the command: **mvn clean install**. This command will perform the build, run the tests and packaging.

### Micro server

 The micro server listens **80** TCP port by default. Running locally you just need to open a browser such Chrome or Firefox with the URL **http://localhost**.
 
### ResourceRequestHandler

To avoid **404** response code any resource request under **/** context will return the content of **/main.html** page. This behavior not applies if the path level is greater than 1, it means that the current request URI contains more than one **/**.

### RestRequestHandler
Only the **GET** http request method is allowed. The rest end points supported are: **/rest/{rock, paper, scissors, computer, configuration}**. Any different endpoint called under the context **/rest** will return the json message: **{"message":"Invalid endpoint: /rest/?"}**. The rest service requests **must** have the http header **Accept: "application/json**, without this header the request will be handled by **ResourceRequestHandler** returning the **404** http response code.

## Configuration

All configuration can be found at **application.properties** file:
````
# Micro server port (optional)
#microserver.port=80

# Micro server max threads (optional)
#microserver.max.threads=100

# Request handlers (required): *comma separated
request.handlers=com.esv.net.server.ResourceRequestHandler,com.esv.net.server.RestRequestHandler

# Default page name (optional): *file name only, without /.
#default.page=main.html

# Resources directory name (optional): *directory name only, without /. **only / is not allowed
#resources.dir=htdocs

# Client http cache max age
cache.maxAge=604800

# File Logging
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = /logs/application.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level = FINE

# Console Logging
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = FINE
````

### Logging configuration

The current Java logging configuration is file based, editing the file application.properties you can change log level, add appenders, etc.

### Unexpected errors

You can open the log file to see more details about unexpected errors in the server side.
